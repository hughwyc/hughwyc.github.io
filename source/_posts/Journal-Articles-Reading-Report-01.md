> Microstructure and hydrogen embrittlement of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V

## 1. ARTICLE CONTENT

### 1.1 Aim of the research

To increase the understanding of: 

* how Ti-6Al-4V micro-structure characteristics vary between selected AM processes, 
* how hydrogen may influence the alloy’s performance. 

### 1.2 Main points & Supporting arguments



### 1.3 Characterization methods

* light optical microscopes (LOM) 
* scanning electron microscopes (SEM)
* neutron time of flight (TOF) diffraction--> to study the texture within the material
* fatigue crack growth (FCG) testing --> to investigate the performance in hydrogen environment

### 1.4 Mechanism



### 1.5 Nice writing expressions



## 2. DEEP THINKING

### 2.1 Unsolved problems



### 2.2 Enlightenment
