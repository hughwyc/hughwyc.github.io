> Microstructure and hydrogen embrittlement of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V

## 1. ARTICLE CONTENT

### 1.1 Aim of the research

To increase the understanding of: 

* how Ti-6Al-4V micro-structure characteristics vary between selected AM processes;
* how hydrogen may influence the alloy’s performance. 

### 1.2 Main points & Supporting arguments

（主要观点和支持性论据）

* In AM built Ti-6Al-4V the β grains morphology changes drastically by changing from 1 to 5 mm in wall thickness. When the wall is thinner than 2 mm, a curved  morphology of the β grains is formed at the outer layer. Which is explained by that the finely curved β grains are nucleated from the surrounding powder bed growing inwards following the melt pool, until meeting an upward growing β grain that nucleates from the previously deposited layer where no powder nucleation was possible.
* 



### 1.3 Characterization methods

* light optical microscopes (LOM) 
* scanning electron microscopes (SEM)
* neutron time of flight (TOF) diffraction--> to study the texture within the material
* fatigue crack growth (FCG) testing --> to investigate the performance in hydrogen environment

### 1.4 Mechanism



### 1.5 Nice writing expressions

* High amounts of α phase, i.e. a large number of HCP crystals,renders the alloy <u>more prone to</u> anisotropy in case of strong texture, <u>due to</u> the inherent anisotropy of the HCP crystal structure.
* The atomic packing factor is slightly higher for HCP than for BCC, 0.74 and 0.68 <u>respectively</u>.
* When the wall is thinner than 2 mm, a curved morphology of the β grains is formed at the outer layer. <u>Which is explained by</u> that the finely curved β grains are nucleated from the surrounding powder bed growing inwards <u>following</u> the melt pool, until meeting an upward growing β grain that nucleates from the previously deposited layer where no powder nucleation was possible.
* <u>What these AM processes all have in common</u> is fast cooling rates.
